# Transcoding Time Prediction 
## üê£ Introduction
We are provided a data set coming from the machine learning repository UCI, a center that give us the opportunity to have access to more than a 500 data sets.
Our goal is to analyze those data, visualize it, and implement a machine learning model that can be used through a Django API.

About the dataset: <a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Video+Characteristics+and+Transcoding+Time+Dataset" target="_blank">(Get the Data here)</a>

The dataset is composed of two tsv files named "youtube_videos.tsv" 
and "transcoding_mesurment.tsv". The first contains 10 columns of fundamental 
video characteristics for 1.6 million youtube videos. 
It contains :
* YouTube video id 
* duration 
* bitrate (total in Kbits)
* bitrate (video bitrate in Kbits) 
* height (in pixels)
* width (in pixels)
* framrate
* estimated framerate
* codec
* category
* direct video link. 

The second file of our dataset contains 20 columns which include input and output video characteristics along with their transcoding 
time and memory resource requirements while transcoding videos to diffrent but 
valid formats. The second dataset was collected based on experiments on an Intel 
i7-3720QM CPU through randomly picking two rows from the first dataset and using 
these as input and output parameters of a video transcoding application, ffmpeg 4 . 

The second dataset will be used to build a transcoding time prediction model and show the significance of the datasets.

## üéØ Objectives

## Data Visualization 
The Data visualization part helped us see the target distribution, and analyze our features.
On the next two plots, we can clearly see that the target variable will need to be scaled.

Furthermore, we could visualize the correlation between the target variable and some of the features such as umem (total codec allocated memory for transcoding) which actually makes sense since a bigger allocated memory for transcoding would increase in some ways the time for it to be done.

## Model implementation  
Now that we've analyzed and plot some of our features, we implemented our model which quickly fitted to our data. 
### Xgb Regressor performance

We can compare our actual model with a linear regression which performs well, but not as good as with our Xgb Regressor.

## API Django
Our goal is to provide a time prediction for each video given by a user. We'll create a Django Api model that can help us implement an endpoint to use any ML model to our actual problem.

Now that we have created our class and instance of ML model, we can try to make prediction through our API.
